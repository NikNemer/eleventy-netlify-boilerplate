Digital assets’ past performance is never a guarantee of future price movement. There are never two identical situations in the crypto market, so even historically similar patterns of a token’s behavior can be followed by starkly different price action charts.

Still, crypto assets’ individual history of price action often rhymes, giving those who can ready this history a massive edge over other traders. And, importantly, some tokens are much more likely than others to exhibit recurring behavior, which makes their bullish setups more recognizable ahead of time.
